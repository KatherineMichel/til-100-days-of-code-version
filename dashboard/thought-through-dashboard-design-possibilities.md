## Thought Through Dashboard Design Possibilities

I thought through design possibilities for the personal dashboard I have been planning to make for a while.

I looked through some examples in GitHub. A few examples:

* A Python script that creates a simple dashboard locally in the terminal
* A JavaScript app that creates an aesthetically pleasing dashboard that can be hosted online
* A Google Chrome extension

I kind of feel like I need to use JavaScript for this project. I'd like to host it online, perhaps via GitHub Pages. 

Would also be fun to make a simple Python script and learn to make a Google Chrome extension. We'll see.
