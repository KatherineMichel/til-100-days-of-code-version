## Finished Work on My Third Hacktoberfest PR

I finished work on my third Hacktoberfest PR, for now at least. It's a scraper... I learned a ton making it. 

There is still a bit of room for improvement, but it's a learning process.

Will move on to my next PR. I want to explore some subjects of interest to me here at the end.
