## Reached the Second Milestone of Django and React Tutorial

I reached the second milestone of a Django/React tutorial I started yesterday. 

JSON objects can be displayed in a table and deleted, with state managed via Redux. 

The project became considerably more complex, but I'm excited to see the results render on the page. 

The next step will be to create a form that will enable users to add leads through the browser.
