## Worked Through a React Video Tutorial

I worked through a React video tutorial. I spent several hours on it, because I wanted to do every part. 

I'm ready to do a ton of project-based learning and integrate my knowledge, which is a great feeling. 

I think this is because I've recently worked on my JavaScript mental model and now I feel prepared to go forward.

I am going to do a Django/React video tutorial next. I'd like to use Django and React together to build some things... two great frameworks.
