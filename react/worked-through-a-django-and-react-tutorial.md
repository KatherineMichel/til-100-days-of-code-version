## Worked Through a Django and React Tutorial

For #100DaysofCode, I spent some hours working through the first part of a Django/React tutorial. 

The tutorial didn't quite work as planned, perhaps because the tutorial has been around for a while and I used different versions of Django and React.

But after some struggle, I did get it working and it was a good feeling to see the content render on the page.

It's a very interesting and powerful combination. 

I'm feeling inspired to make something new with it soon.
