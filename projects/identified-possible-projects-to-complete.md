## Identified Possible Projects to Complete

I'm starting to think that I should call what I'm doing [100 Days of Projects](https://100daysofprojects.carrd.co/). 

Perhaps I will complete 100 Days of Code, then do 100 Days of Projects.

Today, I looked through project ideas I bookmarked during the past few years. I've always intended to revisit some of them, take them apart, and create my own version.
