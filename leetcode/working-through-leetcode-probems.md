## Working Through Leetcode Problems

Politics, natural disasters, and the death of RBG have sidetracked me recently. 

I have done some coding that I didn't formally record through my TIL site. 

Officially getting back on track today by solving Python problems. 

Also, planning to continue with Two Scoops and "batteries included" Django templates.
