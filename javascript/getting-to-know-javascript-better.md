## Getting to Know JavaScript Better

I spent time today creating a mental model to better understand the different ways that JavaScript is used. 

Between client, server, different browsers, different frameworks, there's a lot going on there.

Having a better understanding is something that is important to me personally. 

I want to be able to better recognize different usages when I see them and be able to switch contexts myself easily.

I'm ready to crack it.
