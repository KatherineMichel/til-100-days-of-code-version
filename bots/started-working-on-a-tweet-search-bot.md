## Started Working on a Twitter Search Bot

I created a repo and started the code for a Twitter search bot. Not sure what the end result will look like. 

I looked at the Twitter API docs, official repo with API version 2 branch, and some Twitter search examples on GitHub. 

One I really liked included a word cloud. I plan to do some kind of analysis. And a write-up when I'm done. 

Atm, I'm planning to use Tweepy. Not sure if I'll stick with it. I need to learn more to make a decision. We'll see.
