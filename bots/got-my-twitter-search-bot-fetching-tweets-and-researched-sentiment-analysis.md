## Got My Twitter Search Bot Fetching Tweets and Researched Sentiment Analysis

My Twitter search bot is now fetching tweets. I searched for the phrase 'hello world' as a placeholder.

I used a GitHub Action script and a general approach similar to the one I used for my Stanford Code in Place project bot and TIL bot.

I also used Tweepy again. 

I'm currently just displaying the ids of tweets that have been fetched. I will need to set a limit, because it's exiting due to error. 

I looked at sentiment analysis tools and tutorials. It looks like there are number of ways of doing it. 

I'd kind of like for the entire project to be contained within the repo and run via GitHub Action.
