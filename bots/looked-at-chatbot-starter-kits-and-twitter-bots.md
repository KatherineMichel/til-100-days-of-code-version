## Looked at Chatbot Starter Kits and Twitter Bots

I looked at chatbot starter kits, including Hubot and Howdy AI bot kit. 

For the most part, these were made using node. Not sure why I didn't see a Python starter kit.

Also looked at some bots written in Python. Planning to make a small bot that sends a thank you DM when someone follows me on Twitter.
