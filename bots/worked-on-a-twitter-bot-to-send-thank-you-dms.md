## Worked on Twitter Bot to Send Thank You DMs

I worked on a Twitter bot that will send a thank you DM to new followers. 

I looked at similar bots that have been created using Tweepy. I want to avoid spamming people, lol.

I would prefer to use Twython, but it doesn't appear to be a built-in capability. We'll see.
