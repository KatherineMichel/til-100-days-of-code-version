## Learned How Bots That Can Reply to Mentions Work

I learned how bots that can reply to mentions work.  

I stumbled across an example of how to do this while looking at implementations of how to send a thank you DM to a new follower. 

In general, a function runs that goes through a series of `if` statements... `if` the mention includes a certain word or phrase, a specified reply is made. 

Just like with TIL implementations, I came across quite a variety of bot implementations today.
