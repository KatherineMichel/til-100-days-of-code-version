## Week of Rest

With everything that was going on this week, I didn't formally participate in #100DaysofCode. 

Some elderly, high risk relatives tested positive for Covid and that sort of made it a stranger than normal week psychologically.

I did try out a variety of professional grade Django starter projects. I'm particuarly interested in one that has built-in Heroku support.

I also organized my GitHub stars into a system, including separating out project ideas that have inspired me. I'll make some similar things of my own.
