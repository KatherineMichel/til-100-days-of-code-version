## Solved Code Problems in Python

Yesterday, I was too sleepy to post. Nearly too sleepy tonight too. 

For the last couple of days, I've solved some coding problems in Python. 

In the process, I've gotten to know advanced data structures and techniques better.

Some of the problems I worked on tonight were related to strings and palindromes. They are good for practicing `range`.
