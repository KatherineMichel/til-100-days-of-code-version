## Looked At Real Python Tutorials

I looked at Real Python tutorials about a variety of subject, including... 

* application layout
* debugging
* exceptions
* testing
* itertools
* generators
* zip
* defaultdict
* regex
* CLI
* various projects

The goal was to learn about topics that are high ROI or that I don't know as much about and look for projects to complete.
