## Got to know the Python Standard Library better and read Serious Python

For #100DaysofCode, I got to know the Python Standard Library better. 

I also read part of Serious Python. So far, quite a few ideas in the book are familiar to me from Pinax, especially regarding testing and packaging best practices.

Really liked the "Methods and Decorators" chapter... good explanations of class, static, and abstract methods. Will re-read.

Also, some good info about packaging history. setuptools is #1!
