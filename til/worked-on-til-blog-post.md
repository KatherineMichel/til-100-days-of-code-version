- Status : If all goes as planned, this will be my first proper #100DaysofCode status update auto-tweeted from my TIL GitHub repo. Today, I worked on my TIL blog post and better understanding the four major TIL implementations I tried, including performance considerations.  

## Worked on TIL Blog Post

Today, I worked on my TIL blog post, which included better understanding the four major implementations I considered. Not sure if I will keep the explanations of the implementations in my blog post. I worry it might make it too wordy. But thinking through the implementations was helpful to me personally. 

I better understand [Raegon Kim's TIL implementation](https://github.com/raycon/til/) now, which was frankly, by far, the most difficult to understand, and I still have a small bit of ambiguity there.

I also spent some time researching the performance of `os.walk()`, `os.listdir()`, `os.scandir()`, and `glob`. My first inclination... to use `os.walk()` was not the best, performance wise.

Tomorrow, I will work on a TIL GitHub template and tutorial and will *finally* move on to planning out other projects. :)
