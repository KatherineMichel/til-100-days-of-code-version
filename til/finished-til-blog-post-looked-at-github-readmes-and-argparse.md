## Finished TIL Blog Post, Looked at GitHub READMEs, and argparse

Today, I finished my TIL blog post and posted it on Twitter and Facebook. I'm glad, because I can move on to other projects now. 

I looked at Simon's GitHub account self-rewriting README implementation. It was more loosely coupled with his personal tools than I realized. 

I also looked at argparse. I have a small command line tool package project planned.

Also have a dashboard project planned.
