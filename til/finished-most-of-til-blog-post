- Status : For #100DaysofCode, I finished most of my TIL blog post. Re-worked the section contrasting implementations, to make it more clear. Thinking I will re-start my 100 days now, since I can track my days more easily using my TIL. 

## Finished Most of TIL Blog Post

Today, I finished most of my TIL blog post. Still a bit more to do. I'll know it's done when I'm happy with it, lol. It's not there yet. I'm thinking I will re-start my 100 days now. I only feel that I've properly begun now that my days can be tracked via my TIL.
