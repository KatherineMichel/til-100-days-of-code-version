## Working Through Django Crash Course Every Cheese Exercise

I'm working through Django Crash Course Every Cheese exercise. It's mostly review for me. 

django-allauth is new to me. 

My favorite part so far has been the test section, including the example tests. It's straight forward and practical, imo.  

Also like how settings are broken up into base, local, and production, which I've seen before, I think in Two Scoops of Django.
