## Finished Django Crash Course Every Cheese Exercise

I started working through the book Django Crash Course a while back. I picked it back up last night and finished today. 

The first project "Hello Django" was very simple and the second project "Every Cheese" was much more advanced.

A lot of the content was review for me, but parts of it provided some new clarification and context for me.

Unfortunately, too often, insights are buried in the docs and only come from day to day work experience and study over time.

Audrey and Daniel imparted some short but practical explanations of important functionality, design choice logic, and general website glue.

I felt I got the most value out of the testing sections. Too often, testing guidance is either lacking or overly sophisticated.

This is a subject I have struggled with, but I haven't known where to turn to for practical help.

I felt their guidance was very straightforward and easy to digest.

Throughout the tutorial I learned about some tools:
* django-allauth
* `shell_plus` (part of django-extensions)
* django-debug-toolbar
* factory boy

The tutorial instructions did involve Anaconda, which I didn't use. I used pip instead, which I prefer.

Also, the project settings were broken down by base, local, and production. I've heard of this already, I think from Two Scoops of Django. 

I think it's a good idea and I want to revisit it again, along with the other project configs.

I kind of wish the project configs were less opinionated, in general, but there is a lot that can be learned there.

By the end of the book, I was kind of glad I was done. Now I can move on to playing with the project code. 

I will also take a look at Two Scoops again, which I haven't looked at in quite a while.
