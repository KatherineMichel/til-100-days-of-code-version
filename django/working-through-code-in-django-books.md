## Working Through Code in Django Books

For today and the next few days of #100DaysofCode, I'm going to be working through the code in some Django books. 

A lot of it is review for me, but I'm looking for new insights.

Right now, I'm focusing on books by Daniel and Audrey Feldroy (Two Scoops, Django Crash Course), William Vincent (Django for Professionals, Django for APIs), and Lincoln Loop members (High Performance Django... might be out of date).

Later, I'll move on to other ones.
