## Miscellaneous Code Stuff

Over the weekend, I did a bunch of miscellaneous code stuff. Here are a few:

* Got to know the available JavaScript Web APIs better via the Mozilla Docs
* Got to know the HTTP request/response process better via the Mozilla Docs
* Learned about tradeoffs between Django FBVs and CBVS via a tutorial by Spookey Lukey
* Learned about how to propose, craft, and deliver meaningful tech talks via a tutorial by Nina

One nice thing is that all of these were subjects that I had been wanting to get to for a while.

I'm sure I'm missing something, but in addition to doing some work for my job, that was a lot of learning.
