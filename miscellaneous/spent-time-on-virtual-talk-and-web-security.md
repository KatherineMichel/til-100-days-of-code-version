## Spent Time on Virtual Talk and Web Security

Last week, I put off #100DaysofCodea bit to prepare for and give a virtual talk. I gave the talk on Thursday night to PyLadies Southwest Florida and a number of co-host groups.

Yesterday and today, I learned about web security. I'm watching videos from an excellent course by Feross: https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs253/

Also, going to check out a talk about Django security by Adam Johnson: https://github.com/adamchainz/talk-how-to-hack-a-django-website/blob/master/how-to-hack-a-django-website.pdf
